# OMDB-Challenge

Brought to you by Aisling Hennessy, Vancouver BC

I created a React App for the UX/Web Developer Intern Challenge for an Application to the Shopify Internship, Winter 2021

# The nom init: Movie awards for entrepreneurs

You can find the challenge [here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AZO0BZwn1Aogj4f3PDNe1mhq8pKsXZxtrG--EIbP_-w/preview?pru=AAABdHlQRnE*WQl0v68vsF_nPbygOim7ww#heading=h.31w9woubunro)

Getting Started

Create a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.
